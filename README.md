## Personal Management
This repository contains stuff that I'm learning over the daily course of life. Sort of like a life hack guide as well as a reference guide. Its also an effort to force myself to learn touch-typing everyday, trying to type atleast one article everyday. It contains info from cooking recipes, good programming techniques, financial management tips, philosophy, dealing with friends and enemies, common social clues and info on social interaction, cooking and food tips, health and fitness tips, dieting guides and so on....
