## A set of rules on oral hygiene
#
* #### __A good tooth brush is underrated__
	* Buy a toothbrush that is rough and is not flat on the bristles.
	* The tongue cleaner on the back of the toothbrush is pointless.
	* Do not buy electrical brushes as they are fragile and have lesser control.
#
* #### __Use a proper brushing technique__
	* Wash the brush in cold water thoroughly before brushing. Avoid soap water or warm water.
	* Warm water causes the bristles to become softer and soapwater decays the plastic on the brush.
	* Apply one pea sized toothpaste on your brush (not more, not less).
	* Start from the left molars and end at the right molars (This is debatable so you can go with whatever end you want).
	* Brush from front and back, in circles (wax on, wax off ;)), up and down, in circles, front and back, up and down.
	* The above technique is just for the sides of the teeth, for the top/edge of the teeth brush vigorously back and forth.
	* While brushing, make sure to clear out the spaces in between teeth. They are commonly the hotspots for bacteria.
#
* #### __Once in the day, twice in the night__
	* Brush your teeth first thing the morning. Even before meditation/exercise or any activity.
	* Always make sure to have brushed your teeth before breakfast.
	* If in case you want to brush after breakfast, wait for 1.5 hours after eating breakfast.
	* Our foods contain acids which have the capability to destroy our enamel easily. So brushing right after breakfast spreads the acid evenly.
	* During the night, brush before you eat dinner and 1.5 hours after dinner.
	* When we sleep, our salivation decreases compared to the day and hence enables growth of bacteria.
	* Make sure to drink water before and after brushing. Using salt water is optional.
#
* #### __Flossing shouldn't be ignored__
	* Everyday, a layer of plaque and bacteria form in between your teeth. Remove them.
	* Do not use hair to floss (sounds obvious but a lot of people do it). Hair is absolutely useless at removing anything.
	* Use a proper plastic floss so that you don't cut your gums.
	* Floss gently in between all your teeth. Do not be rough as it can tear down your enamel. But do be firm.
	* Do it twice a day. Once before breakfast and once after dinner.
	* Do it gently and take your time. Brushing + Flossing should ideally take you around 10-15 minutes in a day.
